This repository showcases my coding projects from a range of courses in Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), Mathematics (MA), and Computer Science (CS) at Purdue University, highlighting my diverse coding skills and experiences. The collection includes code written in R, Python, and MATLAB. Most of the courses involved extensive coding tasks, while some provided pre-existing code that required cleaning and data interpretation. Each folder contains a README file with details about its contents.
