# Coursework
In some of my Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science (EAPS) classes, I had to use code that I made or given to me and usebit to interpret data

# EAPS 227: Introduction to Atmospheric Observations and Measurements
+ Throughout this course, we learned principal techniques and instruments used in atmospheric science. We learned what they were used for, their pros and cons, and how to use them. Moreover, we used these instruments, along with python programming and statistical analysis, to carry out a final project along with a report
+ Our main learning was through class lectures, using the instruments in the field, and through MetEd: https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php
+ We realeased a radiosonde in class! A video is on my youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0DdoB83-7U
