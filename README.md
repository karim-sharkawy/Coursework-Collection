# Coursework
This repo is a collection of my coding work across some of my courses at Purdue. This is code consistening of R, Python, and MATLAB. Some of the courses were more involved, while others gave us the code directly and we had to clean and interpret the data. You can find an individual README in each folder. Below are some summaries of what I learned and did in each course.

# EAPS 227: Introduction to Atmospheric Observations and Measurements
+ Throughout this course, we learned principal techniques and instruments used in atmospheric science. We learned what they were used for, their pros and cons, and how to use them. Moreover, we used these instruments, along with python programming and statistical analysis, to carry out a final project along with a report
+ Our main learning was through class lectures, using the instruments in the field, and through [MetEd](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php)
+ We realeased a radiosonde in class! A video is on my youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0DdoB83-7U

# STAT350: Introduction To Statistics
+ A data-oriented introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of applied statistics. Exploratory analysis of data. Sample design and experimental design. Probability distributions and simulation. Sampling distributions. The reasoning of statistical inference. Confidence intervals and tests for one and two samples. Inference for contingency tables, regression, and correlation. Introduction to regression with several explanatory variables. Essential use is made of statistical software throughout.
