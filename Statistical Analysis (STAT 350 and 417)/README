# My-Stats350-Work

This repository includes all of the code using R Studio in Introduction to Statistics Course

# Details about individual files:
1. Final project: Most of the code for the final project is at the end
2. Very important: I don't currently have the old files I worked on for the labs, so I took the code from a different GitHub owned by Jordan Mayer. This isn't a one-to-one copy, as the data  sets and questions were different, but it stills shows the code that we worked with, which would be almost identical.
