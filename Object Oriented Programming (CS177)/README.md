# CS177: Python Programming
+ In my CS 177 class, I explored fundamental programming concepts through various lab exercises, covering a wide range of real-world and algorithmic problems. Early on, I worked on approximating mathematical functions, such as logarithms, using series expansions. For example, one lab focused on computing a logarithm approximation by summing terms of a series expansion, demonstrating concepts like loops, mathematical precision, and comparison with built-in functions. This exercise honed my ability to implement algorithms and evaluate their accuracy against known benchmarks.
+ I also tackled decision-making problems and logical structures in Python. One exercise involved creating a program to calculate the cost of a cap based on user-input attributes, such as brand and size. This lab introduced me to the importance of conditional statements and user interaction, showcasing how to design programs that respond dynamically to user input. Another project dealt with identifying Armstrong numbers, a task that combined mathematical reasoning with iterative processing to filter and append numbers meeting specific criteria to a list.
+ Moving into more advanced topics, I delved into simulation and data processing. A particularly engaging lab involved predicting the number of days it would take for a stock price to quintuple, given a fixed daily growth rate. This required implementing a loop-based simulation while understanding the compound growth formula. Additionally, I developed a simple encryption program that used character encoding and a key-based transformation to encrypt text. Both of these labs enhanced my understanding of algorithmic design and abstraction.
+ Finally, I explored graphical programming and interactivity using Python libraries like `graphics.py`. One project required me to create a spaceship-like design using geometric shapes, while another challenged me to build a program where circles appeared in random positions on a window and disappeared when clicked, with a counter tracking the remaining circles. These exercises not only expanded my programming toolkit but also demonstrated how to create user-friendly, interactive experiences. Through these labs, I gained a solid foundation in programming concepts and their practical applications, setting the stage for more advanced work.
