# STAT 350: Introduction To Statistics
+ This was a data-centered introduction covering the core concepts and methods of applied statistics. It included exploratory data analysis, sample design, and experimental design.
+ We delved into probability distributions and simulation techniques, as well as sampling distributions. The rationale behind statistical inference was discussed, along with constructing confidence intervals and conducting tests for one and two samples.
+ We explored inferential analysis for contingency tables, regression, and correlation. Additionally, an introduction was provided to regression with several explanatory variables, with a strong emphasis on utilizing statistical software throughout.

This repository includes all of the code using R Studio in Introduction to Statistics Course

# Details about individual files:
1. Final project: Most of the code for the final project is at the end
2. Very important: I don't currently have the old files I worked on for the labs, so I took the code from a different GitHub owned by Jordan Mayer. This isn't a one-to-one copy, as the data  sets and questions were different, but it stills shows the code that we worked with, which would be almost identical.
