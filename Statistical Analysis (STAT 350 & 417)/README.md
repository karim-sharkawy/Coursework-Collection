# STAT 350: Introduction To Statistics
+ This was a data-centered introduction covering the core concepts and methods of applied statistics. It included exploratory data analysis, sample design, and experimental design.
+ We delved into probability distributions and simulation techniques, as well as sampling distributions. The rationale behind statistical inference was discussed, along with constructing confidence intervals and conducting tests for one and two samples.
+ We explored inferential analysis for contingency tables, regression, and correlation. Additionally, an introduction was provided to regression with several explanatory variables, with a strong emphasis on utilizing statistical software throughout.
+ My final project involves an in-depth analysis of two distinct datasets using data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques. The first dataset focuses on YouTube video metrics, where raw data on video features such as duration, views, recommendations, and quality is cleaned and processed to facilitate meaningful analysis. The project examines trends across global regions by grouping sub-regions and applies log transformations to normalize distributions for features like video duration. Statistical tools, including histograms, boxplots, QQ plots, and one-sample t-tests, are used to evaluate data distributions and relationships. Linear regression models explore the connection between recommendations and daily views for high-quality videos, with residual analysis and confidence intervals validating the model. The second dataset explores the relationship between state GDP and COVID-19 deaths per capita in the U.S. Faulty data points are corrected, non-representative regions are excluded, and variables are transformed to address issues like normality violations. Scatterplots, residual plots, and histograms visualize the data, while regression models and hypothesis testing provide insights into the economic and demographic factors influencing pandemic outcomes. Together, the analyses showcase the application of statistical methods and visualizations to uncover trends and relationships in diverse datasets.
+ I also utilized several statistical tests to analyze the datasets and derive meaningful insights. I began with a one-sample t-test to examine whether the mean log-transformed duration of YouTube videos significantly differed from a specified value, such as \( \log(702) \), while also calculating confidence intervals and critical values to strengthen the analysis. To explore relationships between variables, I employed linear regression models, analyzing connections like recommendations and daily views for high-quality YouTube videos, as well as GDP per capita and deaths per capita in the COVID-19 dataset. I validated these models through residual analysis, using histograms, QQ plots, and diagnostic plots to assess the normality and distribution of residuals. To further test for normality, I applied the Shapiro-Wilk test, particularly for the regression residuals in the COVID-19 dataset. Additionally, I conducted a one-way ANOVA to compare the mean durations of videos across different global regions, uncovering potential regional differences. Lastly, I calculated correlation coefficients to measure the strength of relationships, such as those between recommendations and daily views or between transformed deaths per capita and GDP per capita. These statistical tests provided a robust foundation for my analysis, helping me identify significant patterns and validate the assumptions of my models.

# Details about individual files:
1. Final project: Most of the code for the final project is at the end
2. Very important: I don't currently have the old files I worked on for the labs, so I took the code from a different GitHub owned by Jordan Mayer. This isn't a one-to-one copy, as the data  sets and questions were different, but it stills shows the code that we worked with, which would be almost identical.
