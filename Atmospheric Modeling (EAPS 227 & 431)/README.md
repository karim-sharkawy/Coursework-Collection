# EAPS 227: Introduction to Atmospheric Observations and Measurements
+ Throughout this course, we learned principal techniques and instruments used in atmospheric science. We learned what they were used for, their pros and cons, and how to use them. Moreover, we used these instruments, along with python programming and statistical analysis, to carry out a final project along with a report
+ Our main learning was through class lectures, using the instruments in the field, and through [MetEd](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php)
+ Conducted group and independent field work

# EAPS 431: Synoptic Lab 1
+ Used Python with weather data to determine properties of the atmosphere
