# EAPS 227: Introduction to Atmospheric Observations and Measurements
+ Throughout this course, we learned principal techniques and instruments used in atmospheric science. We learned what they were used for, their pros and cons, and how to use them. Moreover, we used these instruments, along with python programming and statistical analysis, to carry out a final project along with a report
+ Our main learning was through class lectures, using the instruments in the field, and through [MetEd](https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php)
+ Conducted group and independent field work
+ In my EAPS 227 course, I gained hands-on experience in meteorological data analysis and visualization, using Python and various data science libraries. Through a series of labs, I explored practical applications of meteorological concepts, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I worked with diverse datasets, analyzing everything from classroom air temperature and radiation error measurements to wind speeds, METAR data, and thermodynamic soundings. These projects allowed me to deepen my understanding of atmospheric processes and improve my technical skills in sensor calibration and data interpretation.
+ Some of the key projects I completed included assessing radiation error impacts on temperature measurements and evaluating the effectiveness of radiation shields, analyzing how topography influences wind speeds at different locations, and visualizing weather data through station plots and meteograms. I applied statistical techniques like T-tests and mean comparisons to test hypotheses, and I used tools like MetPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to create advanced visualizations such as skew-T, log p diagrams and hodographs. Throughout these projects, I focused on data quality by performing bias correction, quantifying uncertainty, and calibrating sensors. These experiences not only enhanced my programming and data analysis skills but also gave me a greater appreciation for the challenges and complexities of atmospheric measurements and modeling.
