# CS 314: Numerical Methods
+ In my CS314 Numerical Methods course, I gained hands-on experience applying numerical algorithms to solve practical problems across various domains. I worked on implementing statistical simulations, numerical root-finding, linear algebraic methods, least squares fitting, and classification algorithms. For instance, I simulated biased coin tosses to analyze probabilities, variances, and distributions, helping me understand uncertainty in repeated experiments. I used the bisection method to solve projectile motion problems by determining optimal angles, emphasizing iterative approaches for root-finding in non-linear equations. Additionally, I applied Gaussian elimination to solve linear systems, exploring the numerical stability and sensitivity of solutions through condition numbers.
+ I also tackled real-world problems, such as ranking football teams using least squares and normalization to ensure consistency, and I developed a nearest-neighbor classification algorithm for digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. These projects combined matrix computations, optimization techniques, and data visualization to derive meaningful insights. Furthermore, I constructed high-degree Newton interpolating polynomials to fit functions, exploring the trade-offs of interpolation accuracy. Overall, the course equipped me with a strong foundation in numerical methods and their application to diverse scientific and engineering problems.
