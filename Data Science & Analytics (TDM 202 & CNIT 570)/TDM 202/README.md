Over the course of several projects at The Data Mine, I worked on a variety of data processing, analysis, and web scraping tasks, utilizing tools like Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, TensorFlow, and PySpark. I parsed and analyzed structured XML data, including pharmaceutical and housing inventory datasets, and compared performance between different frameworks for handling large-scale data. I built web scraping scripts to collect information from websites, automating tasks with both BeautifulSoup and Selenium to interact with dynamic content. Additionally, I worked with machine learning models to predict flight delays, performing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. I also gained hands-on experience with system administration tasks, such as port scanning, virtualization with QEMU, and container management using Docker, further developing my skills in infrastructure management. These projects have provided me with a solid foundation in data extraction, analysis, and system automation.
